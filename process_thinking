the tool should be defined as a yaml file with

toolName
args


and chain of tools can also be defined as a json file which is an option for a user to create and config

similar to this 

```
# config/chains/subdomain.yaml
name: subdomain_enum
tools:
  - amass
  - subfinder
output_handlers:
  - type: file
    path: /results/subdomains.txt
  - type: next_chain
    chain: http_probe
```

each tool should have a wrapper around it implemeted in golang
and the wrapper should be able to read the config file and execute the tool with the provided arguments

the project will start with cli tool with tool execttion first and then we can add the chain execution later with chain 
being in mind at development phases


we have two issues one is overwriting the file content from duplicate if a process is crashed and the other one is handling the periodic scan to create a new file_for the scan


only subfinder appends
